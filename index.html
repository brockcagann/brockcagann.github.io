					Graduating from high school in 2002, Brock went to Arizona State University to study his lifelong love of architecture but the summer before junior year he was in a near-fatal car accident.  Required to stay in Indianapolis for therapy and discouraged with what architecture school had become, Brock attended Herron school of art and rediscovered his second love, painting.
